When I Was Six 
by Lorenzo Baldemar Gomez Jimenez

The bus took me and Mami
Away
With that console in my hands

Spaceships
Cars
ATVs
Motorcycles
Blasters
The stars
Crash Bandicoot!

Oh
Boy,
It was Monday
At 3AM
I wake
School is at 8AM

Why not race through
The tracks
With that Spiraling Demon
Surrounding my racer?
Yes!
Through green forests
Dark winter lands
The tight green labyrinths!
Someone put you in the red box
Oh my innocent racer!
It jerks
Thrashes
No mater how hard you try
The player can’t get out
Boom!
It went up in the air
That malvado CPU!




Its 5AM
Yunior
Drop the controller
You don’t wan to upset Mami

Go back to sleep
Turn off that TV
