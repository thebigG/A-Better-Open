Nuclear, Baby

Keep fighting, it won’t be your last time
Keep running, if you don’t, your shadow will reach you
The one that’s with you by the river
The one that casts all your pain into a shape
Or go nuclear, baby

Cry
Laugh
Punch in the code
The countdown will only last as long as you allow it
As long as you run
As soon as you stop
You’ll go nuclear, Baby

Streak
Like a star
In the night sky
Don’t stop until you hit the wall
If you go numb, imagine the smoke
The soldiers on the line
Rifles drawn
Stooped over the battlefield
Ready to go
To Run
To sow
To reap
The seeds
That’ll turn into
Dreams
Of children
And sell it
At 7/11

Meet the one
The one with the eyepatch
The one with the sun in her eye
The butcher that’ll carve your heart
Let her cut deep
Sow the wounds
Patch your soul
Let her take your heart
And freeze it
Then
Go
Nuclear,
Baby

And if you ever go kaboom,
Pack your bags
Set up camp
Strike a match
Start the fire
Get your shovel and knife
Because tonight—
The best night of your life
The one night when you’ll see a fairy taking  a shit
The one time when pain goes to hell—
You go thermo
Big Bang Dreams
Big Fat Sleeps
Dig deep
Into the garden
Cut the rope
Be free
Fall into
The light beneath your feet
Scream
Hold on
With all of your might
Because tonight
You
Go
Hydro
Baby
