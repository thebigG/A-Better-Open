A Rose Drawn with Chalk on the Brick Wall
Today I saw a rose
It had a fat belly at the stem
Filled with the cool breeze of fall
Stuffed to the roots with sweet nectar

It looked at me
Yes!
A rose looked at me!
Deep
With velvet eyes
gazing at my soul
searching for the hollow in me to be filled
And then it spoke
It said, “Why are you crying?”

And I said, “Because I’m happy”

Then It curled into a loop
The soft pedals went around and around
and around
Until it was
A gust of wind
A thin forefinger
Soft
Kind
Love
Wiped the tears off my face
